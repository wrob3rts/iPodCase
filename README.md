The Case uploaded is intended to be Resin (SLA) 3D Printed. I will eventually use UTR-8100 to make the case transparent.

My version is based off of this, just filled in the back as I will print clear: https://www.printables.com/model/638928-ipod-classic-5g-thick-case-with-hexagon-back?lang=de

I literally can't buy a case for the 5G thick for anything less than $90 atm
